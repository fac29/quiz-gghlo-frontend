# GGHLO-Frontend

Welcome to our Quiz App, which we have built with Typescript and React and deployed on github pages and AWS.

## Functionality

Our project is intended to allow you to do the following things (but is currently a work in progress ðŸ˜‰):

- Generate a quiz based on category, difficulty level and whether it's favourited
- Create/edit/delete/favourite questions
- See a summary of your results for the current quiz and the whole session
